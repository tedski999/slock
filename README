slock - simple screen locker
============================
simple screen locker utility for X.

This is a fork made by and for Ted Johnson <ski@h8c.de>. It simplifies
the codebase, removes unused features and adds a pixelated lock screen.


Requirements
------------
In order to build slock you need the Xlib and Imlib2 header files.


Installation
------------
Edit the variables at the top of slock.c to your suiting. At a minimum,
you will need to replace hash with your own hashed password.

Edit Makefile to match your local setup (slock is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slock
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running slock
-------------
Simply invoke the 'slock' command. To get out of it, enter your password.
